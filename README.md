# FlagsToggle

Feature flags are a software development best practice of gating functionality. Functionality can be deployed “off”, then turned on via the feature flag, separate from deployment. With feature flags, you can manage the entire lifecycle of a feature.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'FlagsToggle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install FlagsToggle

## Usage



## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
